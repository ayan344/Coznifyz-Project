 # Project-Restaurant Aggregate Rating Prediction
 ## Objective
 Predict The aggregate rating based on the other features using linear regression
 ## Steps
 ### 1. Data Preprocessing
        Checked missing valuEs,Checked outliers
 ### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):
        Visualise the distribution various independent feature,Geospital analysis,analyse the correlation
 ### 3.Feature Selection & Feature Engineering
       Take the necrssary variable and change them accordingly
 ### 4. Model Building
        Multiple Linear Regression Model
 ### 5. Model evalution
         R^2 and Adj R^2 i
