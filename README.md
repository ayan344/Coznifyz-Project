# Coznifyz-Project
 This respository contains a data science project completed during the internship at Coznifyz.
 Coznifyz:Restaurant Aggregate Rating Prediction.The project includes data preprocessing,exploratory data analysis,
 feature seection,feature engineering,model building,model evalution steps.
 # Project-Restaurant Aggregate Rating Prediction
 ## Objective
 Predict The aggregate rating based on the other features using linear regression
 ## Steps
 ### 1. Data Preprocessing
        Checked missing values,Checked outliers
 ### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):
        Visualise the distribution various independent feature,Geospital analysis,analyse the correlation
 ### 3.Feature Selection & Feature Engineering
       Take the necrssary variable and change them accordingly
 ### 4. Model Building
        Multiple Linear Regression Model
 ### 5. Model evalution
         R^2 and Adj R^2 
 ### 6. Result Interpretation
 This model will help business owners predict their rating on the parameters considered in our model and improve the
customer experience.In this project a number of features
about existing restaurants of different areas in a city andare analysed  to predict rating of the restaurant.
This makes it an important aspect to be considered, before making a diningdecision. Such analysis
is essential part of planning before establishing a venture like that of a restaurant.
